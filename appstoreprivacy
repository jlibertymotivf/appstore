Terms & Conditions
These terms and conditions apply to the CHAD Wildlife©  app ("Application") created by MotivfTM Corporation ("Service Provider").
By downloading or using the Application, you agree to the following terms. It is strongly advised that you read and understand these terms prior to download. Unauthorized copying, modification of the Application or any part thereof, or any attempt to extract the source code, translate, or create derivative works is prohibited. All trademarks, copyrights, data rights, and other intellectual property rights related to the Application remain the property of the Service Provider.
The Service Provider strives to keep the Application beneficial and efficient. The Service Provider reserves the right to modify the Application at any time.
The Application stores and processes personal data provided by users to deliver the Service. Users are responsible for maintaining the security of their devices and access to the Application. Jailbreaking or rooting the device is discouraged, as it may compromise security and app functionality.
The Application utilizes third-party services, each with their own Terms and Conditions:
Google Play Services
Apple Store Services
Some functions require an active internet connection. The Service Provider cannot be held responsible if the Application does not function at full capacity due to lack of access to Wi-Fi or if you have exhausted your data allowance.
If you are using the Application outside of a Wi-Fi area, please be aware that your mobile network provider's agreement terms still apply. Consequently, you may incur charges from your mobile provider for data usage during the connection to the Application, or other third-party charges. By using the Application, you accept responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the Application outside of your home territory (i.e., region or country) without disabling data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you are using the Application, it is assumed that you have obtained permission from the bill payer.
Similarly, the Service Provider cannot always assume responsibility for your usage of the Application. It is your responsibility to ensure that your device remains charged. If your device runs out of battery and you are unable to access the Service, the Service Provider cannot be held responsible.
While the Service Provider strives to ensure that it is updated and accurate at all times, they rely on third parties to provide information to them so that they can make it available to you. The Service Provider accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, that you experience as a result of relying entirely on this functionality of the Application.
The Service Provider may update the Application at some point. The Application is currently available as per the requirements for the operating system (and for any additional systems they decide to extend the availability of the Application to) may change, and you will need to download the updates if you want to continue using the Application. The Service Provider does not guarantee that it will always update the Application so that it is relevant to you and/or compatible with the particular operating system version installed on your device. However, you agree to always accept updates to the Application when offered to you. The Service Provider may also wish to cease providing the Application and may terminate its use at any time without providing termination notice to you. Unless they inform you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must cease using the Application, and (if necessary) delete it from your device.

Privacy and Data Handling

Full name and email address for user login.

Geospatial locations where the user data are created.
Other than the above, no additional security information is stored.
This information is stored within the Application's dedicated storage area. However, if the device is rooted, unauthorized access to locally stored data may occur, although login information remains protected.

Location Data Access and Usage
The Application may request access to your device’s precise or approximate location. 
This information is used solely to associate records, survey points, and mapped data with their geographic coordinates. 
Location data is not used for marketing, tracking, or background analytics unrelated to the primary purpose of the Application. 
Location access occurs only while the Application is in use and is never shared or sold to third parties.

Data Deletion Policies
Locally stored data is deleted under the following conditions:
When a user logs out.
When the Application is uninstalled.
Communication with Third-Party Services
The Application communicates with the following services:
Google Firebase Authentication services.
No data is sold for marketing purposes. Aggregated, anonymized data may be used for research or reporting.
Data Storage Accessibility
There is a possibility that cache and/or locally stored data from this Application can be extracted outside the Application if the device is rooted. However, locally stored data is intended to be within a storage area dedicated solely to the Application.
